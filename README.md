### What I learned

During the development of the NFT Component, I learned how to create a dynamic and interactive website. This project reinforced my understanding of Html and CSS.

### Continued development

I'm interested in reimplementing this rating component using React.js in the future. This will allow me to understand the differences in logic and implementation when moving from vanilla JavaScript to a more structured framework like React.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor Starter Pack](https://www.frontendmentor.io/starter-pack) - This starter pack was invaluable in kick-starting the project, offering base templates and best practices.
